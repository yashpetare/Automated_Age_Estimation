    <h3>Brief:</h3>
Stock Price Prediction using machine learning helps you discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. 
The entire idea of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other 
factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make 
share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy.

Build a Stock Price Prediction Model with any Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques â€“
<h3>Input Data:</h3> Trend Indicators, Momentum Indicators, or any Normal Technical Indicator that can be derived from the Open, High, Low, ClosClose data of a Stock.
<h3>Output:</h3> Stock price for the next day.

The model must be trained on 10 years of daily price data.
Daily Open, High, Low, and Close Data is provided from 2013 and 2023.

<h3>Evaluation:</h3>
The prediction has to be till two floating point numbers.
The Evaluation metric is Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
